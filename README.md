# Eww Today 🕒

- RAW DOG V: I'm making this cause it's hard to find more money doing what I love. Coding and drinking Coffee or Celsius
- AI V: A free, glanceable dashboard for people who love coding, coffee (or Celsius), and just need the essentials to get through the day.

## 🚀 Overview

**Eww Today** is a simple "Magic Mirror"-style web dashboard that shows:

- Current time and date
- Next upcoming event (mocked from Google Calendar for now)
- Quick task list
- Daily quote

## 💡 Why Make This?

I have time. I have dreams. I have will.  
Finding more money doing what I love is hard, so I'm building something small but useful for myself — and maybe for you too.
